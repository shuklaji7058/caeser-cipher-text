#Caesar Cipher Project

Description

This is a simple Python project that implements a Caesar Cipher, a classic encryption technique where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. The project includes functionality to both encode and decode messages with a user-defined shift amount.

Features

Encode a message by shifting the letters forward in the alphabet.
Decode a message by shifting the letters backward in the alphabet.
Handles both upper and lower case inputs by converting all to lower case.
Ignores non-alphabet characters and preserves them in the output.
Allows repeated encoding/decoding sessions until the user chooses to exit. 

Usage

To run the project, simply execute the Python script. The script will prompt the user for input and perform the encoding or decoding based on the user's choice.
